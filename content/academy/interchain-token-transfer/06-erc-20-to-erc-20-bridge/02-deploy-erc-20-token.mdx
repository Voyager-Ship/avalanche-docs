### Deploy an ERC-20 Token

To transfer an ERC20 token from C-chain to your own blockchain, the first thing we will need is the ERC20 token to bridge. You will find a contract in the Starter-Kit under `contracts/interchain-token-transfer/MyToken.sol:TOK` 

```bash 
forge create --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK contracts/interchain-token-transfer/MyToken.sol:TOK --broadcast
```

```bash 
[⠊] Compiling...
[⠰] Compiling 4 files with Solc 0.8.18
[⠔] Solc 0.8.18 finished in 316.86ms
Compiler run successful!
Deployer: 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC
Deployed to: 0x5DB9A7629912EBF95876228C24A848de0bfB43A9
Transaction hash: 0xc6e90bccc21e68edc5707159e636f91245576379329da3f513822fb32bd2bc89
```

### Save the ERC-20 Address 
<Callout title="Note" type="info">
The address `0x5DB9A7629912EBF95876228C24A848de0bfB43A9` is your receiver contract address.
</Callout>

```bash
export ERC20_C_CHAIN=0x...
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Check the Balance

If you deployed the above example contract, you should see a balance of 100,000 tokens when you run the below command:

```bash
cast call --rpc-url local-c $ERC20_C_CHAIN "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" $FUNDED_ADDRESS
```
</Step>
