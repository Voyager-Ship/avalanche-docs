description: Learn how to monitor an AvalancheGo node.
---

This tutorial demonstrates how to set up infrastructure to monitor an instance of [AvalancheGo](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego). We will use:

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to gather and store data
- [`node_exporter`](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) to get information about the machine,
- AvalancheGo's [Metrics API](/docs/api-reference/metrics-api) to get information about the node
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) to visualize data on a dashboard.
- A set of pre-made [Avalanche dashboards](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-monitoring/tree/main/grafana/dashboards)

## Prerequisites:

- A running AvalancheGo node
- Shell access to the machine running the node
- Administrator privileges on the machine

This tutorial assumes you have Ubuntu 20.04 or later running on your node. Other Linux flavors that use `systemd` for running services and `apt-get` for package management might work but have not been tested. Community members have reported it works on Debian 10 and later versions.

### Caveat: Security

The system as described here **should not** be opened to the public internet. Neither Prometheus nor Grafana as shown here is hardened against unauthorized access. Make sure that both of them are accessible only over a secured proxy, local network, or VPN. Setting that up is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but exercise caution. Bad security practices could lead to attackers gaining control over your node! It is your responsibility to follow proper security practices.

Monitoring Installer Script[​](#monitoring-installer-script "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to make node monitoring easier to install, we have made a script that does most of the work for you. To download and run the script, log into the machine the node runs on with a user that has administrator privileges and enter the following command:

```bash
wget -nd -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/avalanche-monitoring/main/grafana/monitoring-installer.sh ;\
chmod 755 monitoring-installer.sh;
```

This will download the script and make it executable.

Script itself is run multiple times with different arguments, each installing a different tool or part of the environment. To make sure it downloaded and set up correctly, begin by running:

```bash
./monitoring-installer.sh --help
```

It should display:

```bash
Usage: ./monitoring-installer.sh [--1|--2|--3|--4|--5|--help]

Options:
--help   Shows this message
--1      Step 1: Installs Prometheus
--2      Step 2: Installs Grafana
--3      Step 3: Installs node_exporter
--4      Step 4: Installs AvalancheGo Grafana dashboards
--5      Step 5: (Optional) Installs additional dashboards

Run without any options, script will download and install latest version of AvalancheGo dashboards.
```

Let's get to it.

Step 1: Set up Prometheus [​](#step-1-set-up-prometheus- "Direct link to heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the script to execute the first step:

```bash
./monitoring-installer.sh --1
```

It should produce output something like this:

```bash
AvalancheGo monitoring installer
--------------------------------
STEP 1: Installing Prometheus

Checking environment...
Found arm64 architecture...
Prometheus install archive found:
https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v3.x.x/prometheus-3.x.x.linux-arm64.tar.gz
Attempting to download...
prometheus.tar.gz                           100%[=========================>]  70.2M   120MB/s    in 0.6s
...
```

The script automatically downloads the latest Prometheus release for your architecture.

You may be prompted to confirm additional package installs, do that if asked. Script run should end with instructions on how to check that Prometheus installed correctly. Let's do that, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl status prometheus
```

It should output something like:

```bash
● prometheus.service - Prometheus
Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
Active: active (running) since Fri 2021-11-12 11:38:32 UTC; 17min ago

Nov 12 11:38:33 ip-172-31-36-200 prometheus[548]: ts=2021-11-12T11:38:33.644Z caller=head.go:590 level=info component=tsdb msg="WAL segment loaded" segment=81 maxSegment=84
Nov 12 11:38:33 ip-172-31-36-200 prometheus[548]: ts=2021-11-12T11:38:33.773Z caller=head.go:590 level=info component=tsdb msg="WAL segment loaded" segment=82 maxSegment=84
```

Note the `active (running)` status (press `q` to exit). You can also check Prometheus web interface, available on `http://your-node-host-ip:9090/`

<Callout type="warn">
You may need to do `sudo ufw allow 9090/tcp` if the firewall is on, and/or adjust the security settings to allow connections to port 9090 if the node is running on a cloud instance. For AWS, you can look it up [here](/docs/nodes/run-a-node/on-third-party-services/amazon-web-services#create-a-security-group). If on public internet, make sure to only allow your IP to connect!
</Callout>

If everything is OK, let's move on.

Step 2: Install Grafana [​](#step-2-install-grafana- "Direct link to heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the script to execute the second step:

```bash
./monitoring-installer.sh --2
```

It should produce output something like this:

```bash
AvalancheGo monitoring installer
--------------------------------
STEP 2: Installing Grafana

OK
deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main
Hit:1 http://us-east-2.ec2.ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports focal InRelease
Get:2 http://us-east-2.ec2.ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports focal-updates InRelease [114 kB]
Get:3 http://us-east-2.ec2.ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports focal-backports InRelease [101 kB]
Hit:4 http://ppa.launchpad.net/longsleep/golang-backports/ubuntu focal InRelease
Get:5 http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports focal-security InRelease [114 kB]
Get:6 https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable InRelease [12.1 kB]
...
```

To make sure it's running properly:

```bash
sudo systemctl status grafana-server
```

which should again show Grafana as `active`. Grafana should now be available at `http://your-node-host-ip:3000/` from your browser. Log in with username: admin, password: admin, and you will be prompted to set up a new, secure password. Do that.

<Callout type="warn">
You may need to do `sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp` if the firewall is on, and/or adjust the cloud instance settings to allow connections to port 3000. If on public internet, make sure to only allow your IP to connect!
</Callout>

Prometheus and Grafana are now installed, we're ready for the next step.

Step 3: Set up `node_exporter` [​](#step-3-set-up-node_exporter- "Direct link to heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to metrics from AvalancheGo, let's set up monitoring of the machine itself, so we can check CPU, memory, network and disk usage and be aware of any anomalies. For that, we will use `node_exporter`, a Prometheus plugin.

Run the script to execute the third step:

```bash
./monitoring-installer.sh --3
```

The output should look something like this:

```bash
AvalancheGo monitoring installer
--------------------------------
STEP 3: Installing node_exporter

Checking environment...
Found arm64 architecture...
Downloading archive...
https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.x.x/node_exporter-1.x.x.linux-arm64.tar.gz
node_exporter.tar.gz                        100%[=========================>]   10.2M  --.-KB/s    in 0.1s
...
```

The script automatically downloads the latest node_exporter release for your architecture.

Again, we check that the service is running correctly:

```bash
sudo systemctl status node_exporter
```

If the service is running, Prometheus, Grafana and `node_exporter` should all work together now. To check, in your browser visit Prometheus web interface on `http://your-node-host-ip:9090/targets`. You should see three targets enabled:

- Prometheus
- AvalancheGo
- `avalanchego-machine`

Make sure that all of them have `State` as `UP`.

<Callout title="Note">
If you run your AvalancheGo node with TLS enabled on your API port, you will need to manually edit the `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml` file and change the `avalanchego` job to look like this:

```yml
- job_name: "avalanchego"
  metrics_path: "/ext/metrics"
  scheme: "https"
  tls_config:
    insecure_skip_verify: true
  static_configs:
    - targets: ["localhost:9650"]
```

Mind the spacing (leading spaces too)! You will need admin privileges to do that (use `sudo`). Restart Prometheus service afterwards with `sudo systemctl restart prometheus`.
</Callout>

All that's left to do now is to provision the data source and install the actual dashboards that will show us the data.

Step 4: Dashboards [​](#step-4-dashboards- "Direct link to heading")
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the script to install the dashboards:

```bash
./monitoring-installer.sh --4
```

It will produce output showing download progress for each dashboard:

```bash
AvalancheGo monitoring installer
--------------------------------

Downloading...
c_chain.json        100%[=========================>]   ...
database.json       100%[=========================>]   ...
machine.json        100%[=========================>]   ...
main.json           100%[=========================>]   ...
network.json        100%[=========================>]   ...
p_chain.json        100%[=========================>]   ...
x_chain.json        100%[=========================>]   ...
...
```

The script downloads the following core dashboards:
- **Avalanche Main Dashboard** - Overview of key node metrics
- **C-Chain** - C-Chain specific metrics and performance
- **Database** - Database operations and performance metrics
- **Machine Metrics** - System metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- **Network** - Network connectivity and peer metrics
- **P-Chain** - P-Chain specific metrics
- **X-Chain** - X-Chain specific metrics

This will download the latest versions of the dashboards from GitHub and provision Grafana to load them, as well as defining Prometheus as a data source. It may take up to 30 seconds for the dashboards to show up. In your browser, go to: `http://your-node-host-ip:3000/dashboards`. You should see 7 Avalanche dashboards:

![Imported dashboards](/images/monitoring1.png)

After completing Step 5 (optional), you will have 8 dashboards including the Avalanche L1s dashboard.

Select 'Avalanche Main Dashboard' by clicking its title. It should load, and look similar to this:

![Main Dashboard](/images/monitoring2.png)

Some graphs may take some time to populate fully, as they need a series of data points in order to render correctly.

You can bookmark the main dashboard as it shows the most important information about the node at a glance. Every dashboard has a link to all the others as the first row, so you can move between them easily.

Step 5: Additional Dashboards (Optional)[​](#step-5-additional-dashboards-optional "Direct link to heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4 installs the basic set of dashboards that make sense to have on any node. Step 5 is for installing additional dashboards that may not be useful for every installation.

Currently, there is only one additional dashboard: Avalanche L1s. If your node is running any Avalanche L1s, you may want to add this as well. Do:

```bash
./monitoring-installer.sh --5
```

This will add the Avalanche L1s dashboard. It allows you to monitor operational data for any Avalanche L1 that is synced on the node. There is an Avalanche L1 switcher that allows you to switch between different Avalanche L1s. As there are many Avalanche L1s and not every node will have all of them, by default, it comes populated only with Spaces and WAGMI Avalanche L1s that exist on Fuji testnet:

![Avalanche L1s switcher](/images/monitoring3.png)

To configure the dashboard and add any Layer 1s that your node is syncing, you will need to edit the dashboard. Select the `dashboard settings` icon (image of a cog) in the upper right corner of the dashboard display and switch to `Variables` section and select the `subnet` variable. It should look something like this:

![Variables screen](/images/monitoring4.png)

The variable format is:

```bash
L1 name:<BlockchainID>
```

and the separator between entries is a comma. Entries for Spaces and WAGMI look like:

```bash
Spaces (Fuji) : 2ebCneCbwthjQ1rYT41nhd7M76Hc6YmosMAQrTFhBq8qeqh6tt, WAGMI (Fuji) : 2AM3vsuLoJdGBGqX2ibE8RGEq4Lg7g4bot6BT1Z7B9dH5corUD
```

<Callout title="Note">
The dashboard variable is still named `subnet` for backward compatibility, but it represents Avalanche L1 blockchains.
</Callout>

After editing the values, press `Update` and then click `Save dashboard` button and confirm. Press the back arrow in the upper left corner to return to the dashboard. New values should now be selectable from the dropdown and data for the selected Avalanche L1 will be shown in the panels.

Updating[​](#updating "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------

Available node metrics are updated constantly, new ones are added and obsolete removed, so it is good a practice to update the dashboards from time to time, especially if you notice any missing data in panels. Updating the dashboards is easy, just run the script with no arguments, and it will refresh the dashboards with the latest available versions. Allow up to 30s for dashboards to update in Grafana.

```bash
./monitoring-installer.sh
```

If you added the optional extra dashboards (step 5), they will be updated as well.

<Callout title="Important">
If you're experiencing broken or missing metrics in your dashboards, running an update is the recommended first step. The dashboards are regularly updated with new metrics and fixes. Recent updates include MeterVM metrics for C-Chain, improved trie operation metrics, and consolidated chain dashboards.
</Callout>

Advanced Dashboards[​](#advanced-dashboards "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The [avalanche-monitoring repository](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-monitoring/tree/main/grafana/dashboards) contains additional dashboards that are not installed by the script but can be manually imported into Grafana:

### C-Chain Load Dashboard

The `c_chain_load.json` dashboard is designed for load testing and monitoring C-Chain transaction throughput. It tracks:

- Issued transactions
- Confirmed transactions
- Failed transactions
- In-flight transactions (pending confirmation)

To install, download the dashboard JSON from the repository and import it via Grafana's dashboard import feature (Dashboards → Import → Upload JSON file).

### Logs Dashboard (Requires Loki)

The `logs.json` dashboard provides log aggregation and visualization using [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/). This dashboard requires a separate Loki installation and configuration.

Features include:
- Real-time log search
- Timeline visualization of log volume
- Ad-hoc filtering capabilities

To use this dashboard, you must:
1. Install and configure Loki to collect AvalancheGo logs
2. Add Loki as a data source in Grafana
3. Import the `logs.json` dashboard from the repository
